# Exercise for Pipeviewer

Original version: [Hands On Systems Programming with Rust](https://github.com/cleancut/pipeviewer), author [Nathan Stocks](https://github.com/CleanCut), published by Pakt

This project replicates of the functionality of [pv](http://www.ivarch.com/programs/pv.shtml), but the main focus of this project is to walk through a hands-on project to teach and demonstrate Rust programming languages features. Each Git tag in this repository is for a commit that corresponds to one of the training videos in the course, so you can walk through the code tag-by-tag if you like along with the course.

I hope you find this repository useful. If you do, I encourage you to check out Agile Perseption course by Nathan Stock at https://agileperception.com
